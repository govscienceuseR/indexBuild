\description{
takes a json work returned by an openAlex query and returns a 1 by X data.table of citation information
}
\details{
Note that because extracted records can be pretty large--and are complicated, nested json file--there is an optional "data_style" command that lets the user specify what to return. Currently there are three options: (1) bare_bones returns OpenAlex ID + DOI, basically, results that can be used to look up the work again; (2) citation returns typical citation information, like journal name, author, etc., with a couple bonus items like source.id to link back to openAlex (3) custom can be tailored to suit researcher aims (note this likely requires building a funciton or two to parse a nested list of interest); and (4) all returns the entire result in original json format.
